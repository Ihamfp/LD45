Ubiquitousse, also known as "The World's Best Video Game Engine Of All Time", despite its perfectness, is still not perfect.
More specifically, what is lacking to officially turn Ubiquitousse into a sacred text, is:
- An i18n API. While some languages are clearly superior to others, the general consensus seems to think otherwise. Ubiquitousse
  should be able to get an ordered list of prefered languages and provide translation helpers. See The Pong.
- Asset management. See The Pong.
- Some API are still lacking an API and/or implementation. Search "TODO" for more information.
- A filesystem API, to access the game's filesystem. May also rewrite Lua's io functions, see the next item.
- A sandboxing system. Ubiquitousse should be able to run in a Ubiquitousse game safely. Since Ubiquitousse can run itself, it will
  then seems reasonable to claim Ubiquitousse run the universe. See World Domination for Dummies.
- A libretro backend, so Ubiquitousse really become ubiquitous. If you didn't know, it's the goal.
- Maybe some compatibilty layer for different Lua versions.
- Some network access. Ubiquitousse needs to spread.
- Weird APIs to allow the backend to manipulate more efficiently the game:
  - Memory / environment access.
  - State saving / Time travel API. Real world Time Travel is optional but preferable.
- Test suite. Ubiquitousse should run perfectly. Including pixel-perfect image output. "Nam√©ho".
- At least a million followers and their souls.
- Sacrifices. A lot of them.
