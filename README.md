# LD45 Project

Our entry for Ludum Dare 45. Setup with love, copy paste, and a lot of git black magic.
Theme's unknown for now, and sources are from... An old place, thousands years old and
forgoten by many: our old LD's dropbox folder.

Some libs are... odly set up. That's normal. Everything is normal. Even if it doesn't
run, everything is normal.
